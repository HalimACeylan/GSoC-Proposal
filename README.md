## Statement of Motivation

### What is your motivation for participating in Google Summer of Code?
In my opinion, open-source programming represents the future of software development. Instead of institutions and companies leading the way, communities are now taking the forefront. This shift towards collaboration and collective problem-solving has given rise to a more inclusive and innovative approach to programming.
